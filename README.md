# nwHacks2021

## Welcome to our How Long to Read app
This app was created with React for the 2021 nwPlus hackathon. No one in the group had worked with React previously, so this served as great practice. To set-up the application to try it yoursel, and for more information, please follow this README.

We would love to implement more backend in the future, currently the application does not use a database or have any functionality, but it serves as a good demonstration of how to use React components.
